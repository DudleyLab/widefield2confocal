1. Scripts and simulated data for performance benchmarking can be found in [simulations](/simulations)
2. Scripts of how to use CycleGAN models can be found [demo](/demo)
3. Pretrained models can be found in [checkpoints](/checkpoints)

### Requirement:
Scripts are developed using Python 3. [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN) will need to be set up properly. See also comments in the notebook.
